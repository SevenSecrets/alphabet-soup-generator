# Alphabet Soup Generator

A neat little app to generate your very own overly-specifically-named niche leftist group so that you too can turn up to protests and hawk your newspaper to unsuspecting students. 

To start the app, run `nodemon server.js` after installing the packages using npm. After that, the app should be running on localhost port 3000. Everything should be self-explanatory from there. Happy newspaper selling! Please don't start any cults.
